        Cooking homemade doesn't have to be complicated. This dish is made entirely from scratch using fresh, simple
        ingredients you can find in any grocery store. So before you grab a can that can of cream of mushroom soup, try
        it my way - I promise you won't be disappointed.

        I use chicken thighs in my Chicken Stroganoff as I find it it has good flavor and retains its moisture well, but
        you can use breast cutlets (thin sliced fillets) if you prefer white meat.

        To use breast meat, dry the thin sliced breasts well with paper towels after rinsing them under cold water and
        then lightly flour them. Flouring creates a barrier between the oil in the pan and the moisture in the chicken
        so that the oil splatters less, and it also helps to produce a consistent brown, crispy exterior while retaining
        moisture in the meat.

        For this chicken stroganoff recipe, I wanted something like the traditional beef stroganoff and threw this one
        together, writing down everything as I went so I wouldn't forget. I served it with noodles, but rice would be
        great too. For a complete meal, make asparagus for a vegetable side and a green or fruit salad. Nutmeg seems to
        be the secret ingredient of many stroganoff recipes.
