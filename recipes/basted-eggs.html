    <p>
        This recipe produces a delicious, simple egg with satisfying, set whites and a creamy, runny yolk. It's similar
        to a poached egg, but more flavorful and less fussy.
    </p>

    <p>
        A basted egg is somewhere between a sunny side up fried egg and a poached egg. Basted eggs are fried on the
        bottom and steamed on top. They look similar to sunny side up eggs, but the yolk is slightly more set.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons salted butter</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch flaky sea salt, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>Melt butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Carefully crack eggs into the skillet and let cook until whites have almost set, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li> Add water, cover skillet with a lid or cookie sheet,reduce heat to medium-low, and let cook until whites
            have set, yolks are still runny, and some of white has set over yolk, 1 to 2 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove lid and transfer eggs to a serving plate. Garnish with pepper and flaky salt, if desired. Serve
            immediately.</li>
