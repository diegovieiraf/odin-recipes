    <p>
        This recipe produces a delicious, simple egg with satisfying, set whites and a creamy, runny yolk. It's similar
        to a poached egg, but more flavorful and less fussy.

    <p>
        A basted egg is somewhere between a sunny side up fried egg and a poached egg. Basted eggs are fried on the
        bottom and steamed on top. They look similar to sunny side up eggs, but the yolk is slightly more set.
